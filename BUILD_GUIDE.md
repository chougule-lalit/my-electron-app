# Building Your Electron Application - Complete Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you package your "Simple Invoice Generator" application into a distributable Windows executable (.exe) file.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

‚úÖ Already Completed:
- ‚úÖ electron-builder installed
- ‚úÖ package.json configured with build scripts
- ‚úÖ Build directory created

‚ö†Ô∏è Still Needed:
- [ ] Application icon (optional but recommended)

---

## üé® Step 1: Create Application Icon (Optional but Recommended)

### Option A: Use an Icon Generator Website
1. Go to https://www.icoconverter.com/ or https://convertico.com/
2. Upload a PNG image (512x512 px recommended)
3. Convert to .ico format
4. Download and save as `build/icon.ico`

### Option B: Use a Free Icon (Temporary)
For now, you can build without an icon. Windows will use a default icon.

### Option C: Create a Simple Icon Using Paint
1. Open Paint on Windows
2. Create a 256x256 pixel image
3. Add text "SIG" or draw a simple invoice icon
4. Save as PNG, then convert online to .ico format
5. Save as `build/icon.ico`

---

## üèóÔ∏è Step 2: Build Your Application

### Build Commands Available:

#### **Option 1: Full Build (Recommended for Distribution)**
Creates installer and portable version:
```powershell
npm run build
```

**Creates:**
- ‚úÖ NSIS Installer (`.exe` installer with wizard)
- ‚úÖ Portable EXE (standalone executable, no installation needed)
- üìÅ Output in: `dist/` folder

**Time:** ~5-10 minutes (first build downloads Chromium for Puppeteer)

---

#### **Option 2: Quick Test Build**
Creates unpacked directory (faster, good for testing):
```powershell
npm run build:dir
```

**Creates:**
- üìÅ Unpacked application folder
- ‚ö° Much faster (1-2 minutes)
- üß™ Good for testing before final build

---

#### **Option 3: Platform-Specific Build**
If you want to customize:
```powershell
# Windows 64-bit only
npm run build -- --win --x64

# Create both installer and portable
npm run build -- --win --x64 --config.win.target=nsis,portable
```

---

## üöÄ Step 3: Build Process Step-by-Step

### Execute the Build:

1. **Open PowerShell** in your project directory
   ```powershell
   cd D:\Lalit\Personal\my-electron-app
   ```

2. **Run the build command:**
   ```powershell
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Wait for the build to complete:**
   - First time: ~5-10 minutes (downloads Chromium for Puppeteer)
   - Subsequent builds: ~2-3 minutes
   
4. **Watch for completion message:**
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ packaging       platform=win32 arch=x64 electron=38.2.2 appOutDir=dist\win-unpacked
   ‚Ä¢ building        target=nsis file=dist\Simple Invoice Generator Setup 1.0.0.exe
   ‚Ä¢ building        target=portable file=dist\Simple Invoice Generator 1.0.0.exe
   ```

   - Used for debugging
   - Not for distribution

---

## üéØ Step 5: Test Your Built Application

### Test the Installer:
1. Double-click `Simple Invoice Generator Setup 1.0.0.exe`
2. Follow installation wizard

- Copy the portable `.exe` file
- No installation needed by users
- Runs from any location

#### **Option B: Website / Download Link**
- Upload installer to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
- Share download link
- Users download and install

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Build Fails - "Cannot find module"
**Solution:**
```powershell
npm install
npm rebuild sqlite3 --build-from-source
npm run build
```

### Issue 2: SQLite3 Binary Error
**Solution:** Already handled in package.json with `asarUnpack` configuration

### Issue 3: Puppeteer Download Timeout
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Set longer timeout
$env:PUPPETEER_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT = "600000"
npm run build
```

### Issue 4: "Icon not found" Warning
**Solution:** Either:
- Add `build/icon.ico` file
- Or remove icon reference from package.json temporarily

### Issue 5: Build Size Too Large
**Why:** Includes Chromium (for Puppeteer) + Electron runtime
**Normal size:** 200-300 MB
**Cannot reduce much without removing features**

   ```json
   "win": {
     "certificateFile": "path/to/certificate.pfx",
     "certificatePassword": "your_password",
     "signingHashAlgorithms": ["sha256"]
   }
   ```

3. **Build with signing:**
   ```powershell
   npm run build
   ```

### Auto-Updates (Optional - For Professional Apps)

1. **Set up update server** (electron-updater)
2. **Configure package.json:**
   ```json
   "publish": {
     "provider": "github",
     "owner": "your-username",
     "repo": "your-repo"
   }
   ```
