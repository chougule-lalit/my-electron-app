# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Simple Invoice Generator

## 1. Introduction & Vision

This document outlines the requirements for a simple, modern, offline-first desktop invoicing application. The primary goal is to provide a frictionless way for small business owners and freelancers to create, manage, and print professional A5-sized invoices.

The application will be developed for the desktop, ensuring all data is stored locally and the app is fully functional without an internet connection. The user experience should be a key focus, aiming for a smooth, intuitive, and minimalist interface inspired by modern applications.

## 2. Core User Stories

- **As a user,** I want to set up my business profile (logo, name, address, GSTIN, food license) once, so it automatically appears on all my invoices.
- **As a user,** I want to create a new invoice where the invoice number and date are automatically generated for my convenience.
- **As a user,** when I add items to an invoice, I want the application to remember them so it can suggest them to me in the future, saving me time.
- **As a user,** I want all calculations (line totals, grand total) to be done automatically and accurately.
- **As a user,** I want to see a list of all my past invoices, with the ability to search by customer name and filter by date.
- **As a user,** I want to be able to open and edit any previously created invoice.
- **As a user,** I want to print any invoice in a clean, professional format designed for A5 paper.
- **As a food business owner,** I want to include my food license number on invoices for regulatory compliance and professional credibility.

## 3. Technical Specifications

- **Platform:** Desktop Application
- **Core Framework:** Electron
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript with Alpine.js for reactivity
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for modern, utility-first styling

## 5. Suggested Database Schema (SQLite)

```sql
-- Stores the user's business details (should only ever have one row)
CREATE TABLE Settings (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    businessName TEXT,
    address TEXT,
    gstin TEXT,
    ownerName TEXT,
    ownerPhone TEXT,
    logoPath TEXT,
    foodLicenseNumber TEXT
);

-- A master list of all unique items for quick suggestions
CREATE TABLE Items (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT UNIQUE,
    rate REAL
);

-- Stores the main record for each invoice
CREATE TABLE Invoices (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    invoiceNumber TEXT UNIQUE,
    customerName TEXT,
    invoiceDate TEXT,
    grandTotal REAL
);

-- Stores the line items for each invoice, linked by invoice_id
CREATE TABLE InvoiceItems (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    invoice_id INTEGER,
    itemName TEXT,
    quantity INTEGER,
    rate REAL,
    amount REAL,
    FOREIGN KEY (invoice_id) REFERENCES Invoices (id)
);
